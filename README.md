# Solid-Waste-Management-Using-Optimal-Path-Planning-and-Autonomous-Bins

• Developed an AI based model for trajectory planning of waste collection trucks based on the prior knowledge of the amount of waste in each dustbin.
• Introduced the idea of autonomous dustbins to collect waste from households.
• Path planning of autonomous dustbins based on evolutionary algorithm (Genetic algorithm).
• Implemented the waste collection model in Blender.
